      To whom it may concern, my name is Lev Merka and I’m an audio engineer
      from Texas but have been working and living in Los Angeles for the past 6
      years. I currently work as a contract engineer for venues as FOH, post
      production for music and film, as well as study MERN Full-Stack, PHP,
      MySQL among others. Before 2020, my work mostly consisted of touring with
      popular musical acts doing sound at theatres and concert halls. Since
      then, I have occupied myself with remote-work of both varieties. I am very
      familiar with Dante networking systems as well as big-stage audio. I’m no
      stranger to thinking on my feet and problem solving under extreme pressure
      in seconds.
