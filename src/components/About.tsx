      To whom it may concern, My name is Lev Merka and I’m an audio engineer
      from Texas but have been working and living in Los Angeles for the past 5
      years. I currently work as a contract engineer for venues as FOH, post
      production for music and film, as well as on-set production. Before 2020,
      my work mostly consisted of touring with popular musical acts doing sound
      at theatres and concert halls. Since then, I have occupied myself with
      remote-work but would much rather be doing what I do best in the field. I
      am very familiar with Dante networking systems as well as big-stage audio.
      I’m no stranger to thinking on my feet and problem solving under extreme
      pressure in seconds. When I moved here from Texas I had no formal training
      but was working at Rock N Roll Rentals the biggest rental house for pro
      audio and live venue equipment in the city. Some of the duties I was
      responsible for were helping clients assemble and tailor a complete rig
      for whatever event they were throwing. This typically consisted of
      loudspeakers, power amps, stage lighting, backline and whatever various
      accessories were required for their event/show/recording session. In the
      meantime, I was playing in bands in the local scene and running the d.i.y.
      shows’ sound (mostly by necessity). Flash forward to moving out here, I
      enrolled in the audio engineering program at Los Angeles Film School in
      Hollywood and was under private tutelage of my good friend from Austin,
      and brilliant engineer Daniel McNeill (Mac Demarco, Kenny Beats, Blaque
      Dynamite, White Denim... etc). During my first month of enrollment I took
      a leave as I was whisked away to be A2 on a North American tour for a few
      months. I probably learned more from jumping in the deep-end here and
      Daniel than I ever did through schooling. That being said, I finished my
      degree and have been doing contract work since then.
